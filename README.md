This vue.js 3 App helps you track the Animes that you're currently watching By searching them through an [Anime API](https://docs.api.jikan.moe/#section/Information/JSON-Notes) and adding them to your Anime List. It also helps you track which episode you're currently watching by incrementing or decrementing the Watched Episodes number everytime you finish watching an episode.

Example : You can type in naruto, then press search. The app will fetch the Animes containing 'naruto' and render them in rows. you then can choose an anime and add it to your Anime List. You then can increment the number of watched episodes whenever you're finished with watching one. You can also decrement in case you have Incremented by mistake.
